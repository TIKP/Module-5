            <h1>What I do</h1>
            <p>I create new web pages from their concept art and implement various online competitions. I also keep the
                website up to date with seasonal changes. I am dexterous in designing responsive web templates using
                HTML5, CSS3, SASS, Bootstrap, and jQuery or JavaScript.

                    <h3>Vanilla JavaScript</h3>
                    <p>VanillaJS is a name to refer to using plain JavaScript without any additional libraries like
                        jQuery back in the days. People use it as a joke to remind other developers that many things can
                        be done nowadays without the need for additional JavaScript libraries.</p>

                    <h3>React</h3>
                    <p>React wants you to break down your UI into components. However, in plain javascript apps, you can
                        only structure the app in one way that seems perfect. ReactJS automatically updates the UI based
                        on modifications and updates within the component.</p>

                    <h3>Node.js</h3>
                    <p>Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable
                        network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it
                        lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across
                        distributed devices.</p>

                    <p>MongoDB is built on a scale-out architecture that has become popular with developers of all kinds
                        for developing scalable applications with evolving data schemas. As a document database, MongoDB
                        makes it easy for developers to store structured or unstructured data.</p>
